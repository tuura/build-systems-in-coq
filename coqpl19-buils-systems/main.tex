\begin{abstract}
The gene pool of software build systems and various incremental computation
frameworks is becoming richer every day. These complex build systems and
frameworks use subtle algorithms and are mission-critical, yet to the best of
our knowledge there is no machine-checked validation of their correctness.

A recent ICFP paper ``Build Systems \`a la Carte'' presented a definition of
correctness for build systems, and modelled several major build systems in
Haskell, without exhibiting any proof of their correctness. We build on this
work by translating the Haskell abstractions to Coq and making the necessary
adjustments to capture the notion of build task acyclicity, which is essential
for proving termination.

This is an experience report on on-going work which is very far from being
complete. We present our motivation and key abstractions developed so far, and
seek feedback and collaboration from the Coq community.

\section{Introduction}

Build systems, such as \Make~\cite{feldman1979make},
\Bazel~\cite{bazel} and \Shake~\cite{mitchell2012shake}, are used by every
software developer on the planet, but their subtle algorithms have not yet been
scrutinised using formal methods. Detailed and executable models of major build
systems can be found in~\cite{Mokhov2018icfp}, however, these models have not
been formally verified.

We believe that developing a formal verification framework for build systems
is a useful, achievable and interesting goal. Modern build systems are
very difficult to test; they use many optimisations whose correctness is not
obvious; they drown in accidental complexity that hides a rich internal
structure --- we hope to address all these issues by looking at build systems
through the lens of formal methods, and, more concretely, by modelling build
systems in Coq.

What is a build system? Below we briefly recite main build systems notions
using the vocabulary from~\cite{Mokhov2018icfp}.

Build systems operate on a \emph{key/value store}, where the keys are typically
filenames and the values are file contents. Some values must be provided by
the user as \emph{input}, e.g. by editing \emph{source files}, whereas
\emph{output} values are produced by the build system by executing \emph{build
tasks}, also called \emph{rules}.

As well as the key/value mapping, the store also contains \emph{build
information} maintained by the build system itself, which is persistently stored
between build runs.

To run a build system, the user should specify how to compute the values for
output keys using the values of its \emph{dependencies}. We call this
specification the \emph{task description}.

A \emph{build system} takes a task description, a \emph{target} key, and a
store, and returns a new store in which the target key and all its dependencies
have an up to date value.

The next Section~\ref{sec-abstractions} formalises these notions in Coq,
followed by a discussion in Section~\ref{sec-discussion}.

\section{The key abstractions in Coq}\label{sec-abstractions}

\begin{figure*}[t]
\begin{minted}{coq}
(* An abstract store containing a key/value map and persistent build information *)
Inductive Store (I K V : Type) := mkStore { info : I; values : K -> V}.

(* Task describes how to build values of type V from keys of type K *)
Inductive Task (C : (Type -> Type) -> Type) (K V : Type) := {
  run : forall {F} `{CF: C F}, (K -> F V) -> F V}.

Definition Tasks (C : (Type -> Type) -> Type) (K V : Type) :=
  K -> Maybe (Task C K V).

 * system returns a new store in which the value of the target key is up to date. *)
Definition Build (C : (Type -> Type) -> Type) (I K V : Type) :=
  Tasks C K V -> K -> Store I K V -> Store I K V.

(* A total Tasks restrict the key of the dependencies to be strictly
* smaller than the top-level one. In this abstract we will fix the type of
* keys of total tasks to natural numbers for clarity.*)
Definition TotalTasks (C : (Type -> Type) -> Type) :=
  forall (k : nat), Maybe (Task C (Fin.t k) nat).

(* Given a total task description, a target key, and a store, the total build
 * system returns a new store and is guarantied to terminates. *)
Definition TotalBuild (C : (Type -> Type) -> Type) (I : Type) :=
  TotalTasks C -> K -> Store I K V -> Store I K V.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{The Task abstraction}

In the Build Systems \`a la Carte framework, the build scenarios are abstracted
as \hs{Task}'s (see the figure~\ref{fig-defs}). A \hs{Task}
describes how to build a value of type \hs{V} from a key of type \hs{K}.
The argument \hs{C} here emulates Haskell's kind \hs{Constraint} and can be
instantiated with concrete typeclass constraints such as \hs{Functor},
\hs{Applicative} or \hs{Monad}.

Omiting the type variable bindings, the task description is a~\emph{target key}
and a task~\emph{semantics}. If the target key is associated to an~\emph{input}
value --- there is~\coq{Nothing} to be done. Otherwise, the~\coq{run} function
contains the~\coq{fetch} callback of type \coq{K -> F V}, which, given a key,
produces a value and possibly couses some side-effects. These side effects are
of immense value and to have flexible control over them is the exact reason to
keep \coq{F} polymorphic.

The \hs{run} field is parametrised by a
polymorphic type constructor \hs{F} which is restricted by the constraint \hs{C}.
The polymorphic \hs{F} is the corner stone of the Build Systems \`a la Carte
framework: given a~\emph{single} task description, we want to explore~\emph{many}
build systems that can build it, exploiting distinctive features of various
type constructors \hs{F}. In the number of cases, \hs{F} will be instantiated
with \hs{State s} for some build-state \hs{s}, or it may become the
\hs{Const K} datatype which allows to statically calculate the dependencies of certain
types of \hs{Task}'s.
