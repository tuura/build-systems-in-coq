\begin{abstract}
The gene pool of software build systems and various incremental computation
frameworks is becoming richer every day. These complex build systems and
frameworks use subtle algorithms and are mission-critical, yet to the best of
our knowledge they come with no formal proofs of correctness.

%  are no formal verification
%  their correctness has not
% there is no machine-checked validation of their correctness.

A recent ICFP paper ``Build Systems \`a la Carte'' presented a definition of
correctness for build systems, and modelled several major build systems in
Haskell, without exhibiting any proof of their correctness. We build on this
work by translating the Haskell abstractions to Coq and making the necessary
adjustments to capture the notion of build task acyclicity, which is essential
for proving termination.

This is an experience report on on-going work which is very far from being
complete. We present our motivation and key abstractions developed so far, and
seek feedback and collaboration from the Coq community.

\section{Introduction}
\vspace{-1mm}

Build systems, such as \Make~\cite{feldman1979make},
\Bazel~\cite{bazel} and \Shake~\cite{mitchell2012shake}, are used by every
software developer on the planet, but their subtle algorithms have not yet been
scrutinised using formal methods. Detailed and executable models of major build
systems can be found in~\cite{Mokhov2018icfp}, however, these models have not
been formally verified.

We believe that developing a formal verification framework for build systems
is a useful, achievable and interesting goal. Modern build systems are
very difficult to test; they use many optimisations whose correctness is not
obvious; they drown in accidental complexity that hides a rich internal
structure --- we hope to address all these issues by looking at build systems
through the lens of formal methods, and, more concretely, by modelling build
systems in Coq.

What is a build system? Below we briefly recite main build systems notions
using the vocabulary from~\cite{Mokhov2018icfp}.

Build systems operate on \emph{key/value stores}, where the keys are typically
filenames and the values are file contents. Some values must be provided by
the user as \emph{input}, e.g. by editing \emph{source files}, whereas
\emph{output} values are produced by the build system by executing \emph{build
tasks} (also called \emph{build rules}).

As well as the key/value mapping, the store also contains \emph{build
information} maintained by the build system itself, which is persistently stored
between build runs.

To run a build system, the user should specify how to compute the values for
output keys using the values of its \emph{dependencies}. We call this
specification the \emph{task description}.

A \emph{build system} takes a task description, a \emph{target} key, and a
store, and returns a new store in which the target key and all its dependencies
have an up to date value.

% The next Section~\ref{sec-abstractions} formalises these notions in Coq,
% followed by a brief discussion in Section~\ref{sec-discussion}.

\caption{Build system abstractions in Coq.}\label{fig-defs}
\vspace{-4mm}
\end{figure*}

Following the approach in~\cite{Mokhov2018icfp}, we model \hs{Store} as
an abstract data type parameterised by the type of keys~\hs{K}, values~\hs{V},
and build information~\hs{I} (see the Fig.~\ref{fig-defs}). A \hs{Task}
describes how to compute a value of a key (\hs{F V}), given a way to find values
of its dependencies (the callback \hs{K -> F V}). The type of effect~\hs{F}
associated with computing values is constrained by~\hs{C}, which emulates
Haskell's kind \hs{Constraint} and can be instantiated with concrete constraints,
such as \hs{Applicative} (for statically known task dependencies, e.g. as in \Make)
and \hs{Monad} (for dynamic dependencies, which become known only during the
execution of a task, as in \Shake).

A \hs{Tasks} associates a task to a every output key, and \hs{Nothing} to input
keys. Just like a single \hs{Task}, the compound task description \hs{Tasks} is
polymorphic over the effect type~\hs{F}. It is very important to have the
flexibility of interpreting the very same task description in
different~\hs{F}'s: (i) a build system typically fixes \hs{F} to some state
monad in order to side-effect the \hs{Store} during the build; (ii) furthermore,
to extract accurate \emph{task dependencies}, a task can be executed in a
\emph{tracking} \hs{Applicative} (e.g. \hs{Const}) or \hs{Monad}
(e.g. \hs{Writer}).

As an example, consider the following task description for computing generalised
Fibonacci sequence:

\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Definition fibonacci : Tasks Applicative nat nat :=
  fun n =>
  match n with
  | 0  => Nothing
  | 1  => Nothing
  | S (S m) => Just {|
               run := fun _ _ => fun fetch =>
                      Nat.add <$> fetch (S m)
                              <*> fetch m |}
  end.
\end{minted}
\vspace{-1mm}

\noindent
The keys~\coq{0} and~\coq{1} are inputs (i.e. the user may choose
how to initialise the first two elements of the generalised Fibonacci sequence),
and are therefore associated to \hs{Nothing}. All other keys are associated to
non-trivial tasks that, given the callback \hs{fetch}, use it to find the values
of the two previous Fibonacci numbers in the sequence and return their sum.

Dependencies of applicative tasks can be calculated
statically~\cite{free-applicatives}, without providing any actual values:

\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Definition dependencies {K V : Type}
  (task : Task Applicative K V) :
  list K := getConst
    ((run task) (fun k => mkConst (cons k nil))).
\end{minted}
\vspace{-1mm}

\noindent
The function~\hs{dependencies} instantiates~\hs{F} to~\hs{Const (list K)} and
executes the task with a~\hs{fetch} callback that just records the fetched key.
The keys then get accumulated to a list by the \hs{Applicative} instance
of~\hs{Const K} data type.

The~\hs{fibonacci} task description is applicative, and hence can be statically
analysed. The correctness of the function \hs{dependencies} is trivially proved
in this specific case:

\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Theorem deps_fib_correct : forall n,
  deps_fib (S (S n)) = (S n :: n :: nil).
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
\end{minted}
\vspace{-1mm}

Task descriptions trap the recursion inside the \hs{fetch} callback. In case of
the function~\hs{dependencies}, the callback is not recursive, and the function
always terminates. However, build systems described in~\cite{Mokhov2018icfp}
require a \emph{recursive callback}: indeed, to find the value of a dependency we
may need to rebuild it, which may trigger further recursive rebuilds.
Termination is no longer guaranteed in such settings. To tackle this issue, we
introduce the notion of \emph{acyclic task descriptions}.

% At this point, we have not managed to encode even the simples build
% system~\hs{busy}, because Coq's termination checker is a hard judge to persuade.

% \vspace{-3mm}
% \subsection{Acyclic Tasks}

We extend the framework presented in~\cite{Mokhov2018icfp} by introducing the
type of \hs{AcyclicTasks}. In contrast to the regular, possibly cyclic
\hs{Tasks}, a task that belongs to \hs{AcyclicTasks} can only depend on keys
that are smaller than its own key, which is expressed as dependently-typed
function.

% : the type of keys depends on the value of the target key.
% Thus, every call of the \hs{fetch} callback can only be performed with a smaller key.
% The Fibonacci function can also be represented as an acyclic task:

\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Definition fibonacci :
  AcyclicTasks Applicative := fun n =>
  match n with
  | 0  => Nothing
  | 1  => Nothing
  | S (S m) => Just
      {| run := fun _ _ => fun fetch =>
           Nat.add <$> fetch (from_nat (S m))
                   <*> fetch (inject1 (from_nat m)) |}
  end.
\end{minted}
\vspace{-1mm}

\vspace{-3mm}
\section{Discussion}\label{sec-discussion}
\vspace{-1mm}

The Haskell-embedded framework for modelling build systems presented in the
paper~\cite{Mokhov2018icfp} exploits GHC's~\emph{Rank2Types}
and~\emph{ConstraintKinds} to achieve high level of brevity and code reuse.
Coq's type system is reach enough to emulate these features and we have been able
to define all the required abstractions. However, since Coq is a total language,
defining even the simplest build system~\hs{busy} requires a lot more
effort than anticipated.

Even restricting the~\hs{Tasks} abstraction to
supposingly always terminating~\hs{AcyclicTasks} has not made the problem easier.

The main take-away from this experience for us is the necessity to rigorously
prove the totality of a build system before even attempting to prove its correctness.
