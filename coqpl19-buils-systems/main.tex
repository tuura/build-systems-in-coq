\begin{abstract}
The gene pool of software build systems and various incremental computation
frameworks is becoming richer every day. These complex build systems and
frameworks use subtle algorithms and are mission-critical, yet to the best of
our knowledge there is no machine-checked validation of their correctness.

A recent ICFP paper ``Build Systems \`a la Carte'' presented a definition of
correctness for build systems, and modelled several major build systems in
Haskell, without exhibiting any proof of their correctness. We build on this
work by translating the Haskell abstractions to Coq and making the necessary
adjustments to capture the notion of build task acyclicity, which is essential
for proving termination.

This is an experience report on on-going work which is very far from being
complete. We present our motivation and key abstractions developed so far, and
seek feedback and collaboration from the Coq community.

\section{Introduction}
\vspace{-1mm}

Build systems, such as \Make~\cite{feldman1979make},
\Bazel~\cite{bazel} and \Shake~\cite{mitchell2012shake}, are used by every
software developer on the planet, but their subtle algorithms have not yet been
scrutinised using formal methods. Detailed and executable models of major build
systems can be found in~\cite{Mokhov2018icfp}, however, these models have not
been formally verified.

We believe that developing a formal verification framework for build systems
is a useful, achievable and interesting goal. Modern build systems are
very difficult to test; they use many optimisations whose correctness is not
obvious; they drown in accidental complexity that hides a rich internal
structure --- we hope to address all these issues by looking at build systems
through the lens of formal methods, and, more concretely, by modelling build
systems in Coq.

What is a build system? Below we briefly recite main build systems notions
using the vocabulary from~\cite{Mokhov2018icfp}.

Build systems operate on a \emph{key/value store}, where the keys are typically
filenames and the values are file contents. Some values must be provided by
the user as \emph{input}, e.g. by editing \emph{source files}, whereas
\emph{output} values are produced by the build system by executing \emph{build
tasks}, also called \emph{rules}.

As well as the key/value mapping, the store also contains \emph{build
information} maintained by the build system itself, which is persistently stored
between build runs.

To run a build system, the user should specify how to compute the values for
output keys using the values of its \emph{dependencies}. We call this
specification the \emph{task description}.

A \emph{build system} takes a task description, a \emph{target} key, and a
store, and returns a new store in which the target key and all its dependencies
have an up to date value.

The next Section~\ref{sec-abstractions} formalises these notions in Coq,
followed by a discussion in Section~\ref{sec-discussion}.

\subsection{The Task abstraction}

In the Build Systems \`a la Carte framework, the build scenarios are abstracted
as \hs{Task}'s (see the figure~\ref{fig-defs}). A \hs{Task}
describes how to build a value of type \hs{V} from a key of type \hs{K}.
The argument \hs{C} here emulates Haskell's kind \hs{Constraint} and can be
instantiated with concrete typeclass constraints such as \hs{Functor},
\hs{Applicative} or \hs{Monad}.

A \hs{Tasks} associates a task to a ~\emph{target key}.
If the target key is associated to an~\emph{input}
value --- there is~\hs{Nothing} to be done. Otherwise, the~\hs{run} function
contains a callback of type \hs{K -> F V} (conventionly called~\hs{fetch}),
which, given a key, produces a value and possibly couses some side-effects.
These side effects are of immense value here and to have flexible control over them
is the exact reason to keep \hs{F} polymorphic.

The polymorphic \hs{F} is the corner stone of the Build Systems \`a la Carte
framework: given a~\emph{single} task description, we want to explore~\emph{many}
build systems that can build it, exploiting distinctive features of various
type constructors \hs{F}. In the number of cases, \hs{F} will be instantiated
with \hs{State s} for some build-state \hs{s}, or it may become the
\hs{Const K} datatype which allows to statically calculate the dependencies of certain
types of \hs{Task}'s.

\vspace{-3mm}
\subsection{The Build abstraction}

Given a task description, a target key, and a store, the build
system returns a new store in which the value of the target key is up to date.
The Haskell model of build systems guaranties the termination and correctness of
a build system only under the assumption that the build task under
consideration is acyclic. The Haskell model leaves it on the user
to make sure that their tasks terminate.

\vspace{-3mm}
\subsection{Acyclic Tasks}

We attempt to modify the build systems framework and encode the always terminating
task descriptions as the~\hs{AcyclicTasks} datatype. In contrasts with the regular,
possibly non-terminating \hs{Tasks}, acyclic task descriptions are represented as
a dependent function and the type of keys depends on the value of the target key:
\hs{Maybe (Task C (Fin.t k) nat)}. This means that every call of the \hs{fetch}
callback can only be performed with a smaller key. We are trying to facilitate the
proofs of termination of the~\hs{busy} build system from~\cite{Mokhov2018icfp}
by establishing a well-founded order on~\hs{AcyclicTasks}:

\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Definition depth
  {C : (Type -> Type) -> Type}
  {F : (Type -> Type)} `{CF: C F}
  (key : nat) (tasks : AcyclicTasks C) : nat :=
  match tasks key with
  | Nothing => 0
  | Just _  => key
  end.
\end{minted}

The~\hs{depth} of the task is zero if the target key is an input one, otherwise
the depth is equal to the value of the key. Once this order has been proved to be
well-founded (we haven not done it yet), it will help to formulate the definition
of the~\hs{busy} build system in Coq and prove its totality.

The following listing contains the definition of the~\hs{fetch} callback to be
used in the~\hs{busy} build system.

\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{minted}{coq}
Program Fixpoint busyFetch
  {C : (Type -> Type) -> Type}
  (tasks : AcyclicTasks C) (k : nat)
  {measure (depth tasks k)}:
  (State (Store unit nat nat) nat) :=
    match tasks k  with
    | Nothing  => gets (getValue k)
    | Just task => run task (busyFetch tasks) >>=
          fun v => modify (putValue k v) >> pure v
    end.
\end{minted}
\vspace{-1mm}

The definition doesn't type check, but gives
an idea of proof of termination of the~\hs{busy} build system for acyclic tasks:
if the~\hs{AcyclicTasks} contains~\hs{Nothing} then the key is an input, hence the
associated value is retuned; otherwise the~\hs{task} is run with the~\hs{busyFetch}
callback, supposingly supplying a proof that the recursive call is performed on a
strictly smaller key. Unfortunately, we are struggling with technical details and
thus seek guidance in defining this function properly.

\vspace{-3mm}
\section{Discussion}\label{sec-discussion}
\vspace{-1mm}

The Haskell-embedded framework for modelling build systems presented in the
paper~\cite{Mokhov2018icfp} exploits GHC's~\emph{Rank2Types}
and~\emph{ConstraintKinds} to achieve high level of brevity and code reuse.
Coq's type system is reach enough to emulate these features and we have been able
to define all the required abstractions. However, since Coq is a total language,
defining even the simplest build system~\hs{busy} requires a lot more
effort than anticipated. Even restricting the~\hs{Tasks} abstraction to
supposingly always terminating~\hs{AcyclicTasks} has not made the problem easier.

The main take-away from this experience for us is the necessity to rigorously
prove the totality of a build system before even attempting to prove its correctness.
